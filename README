Welcome to the world of Jabber 1.4!

This README is very sparse. Visit jabberd's homepage for further
documentation including an installation guide and configuration
hints.

  Installation instructions

    Read
    http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/1.4/doc/adminguide
    for an in-depth installation guide!

  First, untar or move this folder into the final install location
  (such as /usr/local/jabber)

  To build, run "./configure" and then type "make"

  Edit jabber.xml, replace "localhost" by the host name of your
  server throughout the file. Edit other values as desired.

  To start:
    ./jabberd/jabberd -h your.domain.name &

  Optional: for lots of debug output, use the -D flag

  Optional: to specify a config file other than ./jabber.xml, use
  -c /path/to/file.xml

  Error messages are written to the ./error.log and copied to STDERR.

  To test operation, connect to the domain name you used with any
  client and register new users.

-----------------------

If there are any rough areas or problems on any platforms or
environments, please feel free to report them and assist us in
correcting it. Email bug reports to bugs@jabber.org, including your
config file (if you've made any significant changes) and -D debug
output.
