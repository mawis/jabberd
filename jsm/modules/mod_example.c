Welcome!

So... you want to play with the innards of jsm, huh?  Cool, this should be fun, and it isn't too hard either :)

The API that you're going to be working with is starting to show it's age, it was created back in the era of 0.9, in early 2000.
It's still quite functional and usable, but not as clean as a purist geek might like.  Don't hesistate to code against it though,
it's not going anywhere until the 2.0 release (probably 02), and even then we'll make sure it remains as compatible as possible (if not fully).

A very general overview:
 -> packets come into jsm
 -> jsm tracks "sessions", or logged in users
 -> jsm determins the right session, and the packet is delivered to that session
 -> packets can either be of the type the user generated and is sending (OUT) or receiving from others (IN)
 -> modules are called to process the packets

Modules can also hook in when a session starts, ends, and when packets are just send to="server" or when the user is offline.
Most of the module api symbols, defines, etc are defined in the jsm.h file, consult it frequently.

To get your module building, it's very ugly right now, but either compile it by hand to a .so and include it in the jabber.xml,
or edit the jsm/Makefile and jsm/modules/Makefile and include it in the jabber.xml just like the other modules (cut/paste/edit a few lines in all those files).

You can often follow the logic bottom-up, the first function that registers the module is at the bottom, and subsequent callbacks are above it.
So, head to the bottom of this file to get started!

       m->packet    the packet that this callback is processing, see the jpacket_* functions in lib.h, and m->packet->x is the xmlnode of the actual data (xmlnode_* in lib.h too)
       m->e         the e_EVENT that this call is, not usually used unless you're overloading a function
       m->user      the udata struct, containing generic information about the user this packet is related to
       m->s         the session struct, data for the particular session
    */

       M_IGNORE     I never want to see this m->packet->type again, I don't handle those
       M_HANDLED    I consumed the m->packet and processed it, it is no longer valid, I've resent it or free'd it
    */
