jadc2s - jabberd client-to-server connection manager
----------------------------------------------------
http://jabberd.jabberstudio.org/1.4/doc/jadc2s

This is a simple daemon that manages incoming connections from clients.
It can be used as a fast c2s connection manager for jabberd 1.4.x and
other Jabber server implementations.
It handles parsing the appropriate parts of the stream to process
authentication requests and which connections have been authorized as a
valid session.

The internals right now are stripped from the jabberd-1.4.x release,
consisting of a simple main select loop that processes the socket events,
and callbacks in expat to track incoming packets to handle them as auth or
deliver them to a session manager.

For testing with jabberd-1.4.x create a file called c2s.xml configuring
your main jabberd server to listen for component connections on port 5111:

<service id="jadc2s">
  <accept>
    <ip/>
    <port>5111</port>
    <secret>secret</secret>
  </accept>
</service>

And start jabberd 1.4.x with the command line
  ./jabberd/jabberd -h yourhostname -i c2s.xml

Now, edit jadc2s.xml to your liking, then start jadc2s:
  ./jadc2s

jadc2s will then connect to your Jabber server on port 5111 and listen for
normal Jabber c2s connections on port 5221 (for testing).

If you need jadc2s to handle many c2s connections don't forget to raise
its file handle limit (typically done with "ulimit -n 8192").
