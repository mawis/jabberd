Welcome to the world of jabberd14!

This README is very sparse. Visit jabberd's homepage for further
documentation including an installation guide and configuration
hints.

For quick information on what has to be changed if you upgrade
from an older version of this software, please look at the
UPGRADE file. In the NEWS file you get a list of what has changed
in the server functionality. Both files might be of interest for
users of prior versions of this software.

If you need support for your jabberd14, please go to

If you need a new X.509 certificate for you server, you can get
one for free on the XMPP federation page at https://www.xmpp.net/.

  Installation instructions

  First untar or move this folder into a directory where you
  want to compile your server.

  Run the configure script, passing options to customize some
  compile settings and where to install the compiled server:
  e.g.: ./configure --prefix=/usr

  Compile jabberd14 by typing "make".

  If your server is compiled, you can install it using "make install".

  Edit jabber.xml, replace "localhost" by the host name of your
  server throughout the file. Edit other values as desired.

  To start:
    jabberd -h your.domain.name -B

  Optional: for lots of debug output, use the -D flag

  Optional: to specify a config file other than ./jabber.xml, use
  -c /path/to/file.xml

  Error messages are written to your system logfile by default.

  To test operation, connect to the domain name you used with any
  client and register new users.
