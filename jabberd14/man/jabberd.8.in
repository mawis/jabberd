jabberd \- jabberd daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jabberd
.I [-B] [-c config] [-d mask | -D] [-H dir] [-v] [-V] [-Z zone(s)] [-I dir]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR jabberd
is the core of the jabber server containing the routing functionality that
is extended by specific logic, that is loaded from shared objects specified
in the configuration file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-B
Background the jabberd process. (This option is disabled in debugging mode.)
.TP
.B \-c
Specify an alternate configuration file. Default is to use
@sysconfdir@/jabber.xml
.TP
.B \-U <user>
Run jabberd as <user>.
.TP
.B \-d <mask>
Output debugging information while running. This option disabled
backgrounding of the jabberd process. The debugging output is either
written to syslog or to the standard error output (configured in
jabber.xml). The given mask is ORed with the mask given in the
configuration file and each bit in the result enables a category of
debug logging messages. You can further limit the information that
is printed by using the -Z option.
.TP
.B \-D
Like -d but enables debugging output of all types.
.TP
.B \-H <dir>
Resolve paths relative to this directory.
.TP
.B \-v \-V
Print jabberd version information.
.TP
.B \-Z <zones>
Limit the debugging output to a given set of zones in the source code.
Comma separated list of zones. Zones are the file names of the source
files without the extension. (E.g. debugging statements in 'jabberd.c'
correspond to the zone 'jabberd'.)
.TP
.B \-I <dir>
Import data from a spool directory to the storage engine configured
in the current configuration file. This is intended to be used for
migration from xdb_file storage to xdb_sql. The directory you specify
should be the directory, that contains the directories, that are named
after the domains of your server. This is typically something like
PREFIX/var/spool/jabberd.
