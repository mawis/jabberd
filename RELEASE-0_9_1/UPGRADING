Upgrading from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1
-----------------------------

Upgrading to 0.9.1 should be an easy task. No modifications to your existing
configuration file should be needed. But it is suggested, that you have a
look at the new default configuration file (jabber.xml.dist), as the
configuration now contains some more options (especially related to SSL/TLS).

There is a change in how to compile your jadc2s. Standard procedures are now
used. What you probably want to do is:

./configure --prefix=/where/to/install/jadc2s --enable-ssl
make
make install

If you need flash support, add the "--enable-flash" option to the configure
call. If you want to send log messages to your syslogd, add the
"--enable-syslog" option.

To build jadc2s, you will now need some libraries to be installed, that were
not needed with jadc2s 0.9.0. The configure script will tell you, if one
of these libraries (or the development package for it) is missing.
