    * jabberd14 now uses an automake/autoconf build environment
    * jabberd14 now handles negative priorities and won't consider sessions
      with negative priority for default delivery
    * the server will now unsubscribe all subscriptions when an user
      unregisters his account
    * jabberd14 is now able to send log messages to the syslog
    * the activation of debugging output has been changed: you can either
      activate debugging in the configuration file or in the command line
      using the -D option (that now takes an argument)
    * there is a small utility xdbfiletool that helps accessing xdb_file's
      new directory layout and that can convert old spools to the new
      format
    * jabberd14 will now try to establish s2s connections not only on the
      first IPv4/IPv6 address it finds in DNS but on any IPv4/IPv6 address,
      that can be found for the first matching service. (It will not fall
      back to pure AAAA or A records if there has been a SRV record for
      any configured service.)
      This will now allow a jabberd14, that has been configured with
      --enable-ipv6, to be used on systems without IPv6 routing as well.
    * jabberd14 now requires at least openssl version 0.9.7 to be build with
      support for SSL
    * support for legacy jabberd 1.0 server to server communication is now
      disabled by default as it has not protection against identity spoofing
